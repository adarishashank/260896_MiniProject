## Project Description

In this project we have us3ed BeautifulSoup library where we scrape data from web browser and collect the weather forecast information at the given time and recall it to the compiler, then the output is shown in the terminal.

### What is BeautifulSoap?

Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. We use _pip install beautifulsoup4_ to install the library.
